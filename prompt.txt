### **Industry: Private Education (Tuition & Enrichment Centres)**

-   **Specific Challenge:** Tuition centres thrive on parent
    > satisfaction and communication. However, teachers are often bogged
    > down with administrative communication—answering parent queries on
    > WhatsApp, tracking payments, and manually sending updates—which
    > takes time away from teaching and lesson planning.

-   **Proposed Solution: The "Parent Engagement & Admin Portal"  
    > **A lightweight, branded web and mobile portal that streamlines
    > the most common administrative and communication tasks between the
    > centre, students, and parents.

    -   **Core Features:**

        1.  **Automated Payment Reminders:** The system automatically
            > sends SMS or email reminders to parents a week before
            > school fees are due and tracks payment status,
            > significantly reducing the manual work of chasing
            > payments.

        2.  **Progress Snapshot Uploader:** A simple interface for
            > teachers to upload a quick photo of a student's completed
            > work or write a short, templated progress note after each
            > class. Parents receive a notification and can view these
            > updates in their portal, keeping them engaged and
            > informed.

        3.  **Smart Class Scheduling & Notifications:** Manages class
            > schedules and sends automated reminders for upcoming
            > lessons or notifications for last-minute changes (e.g., a
            > change of venue or teacher).

    -   **Why it's a good opportunity:** This is a customer experience
        > differentiator. In a competitive market, a centre that offers
        > seamless communication and convenient admin is more likely to
        > retain students. It solves a major time-sink for the centre's
        > most valuable assets: its teachers.

### **Industry: Beauty & Wellness (Salons, Spas, Aesthetic Clinics)**

-   **Specific Challenge:** The single biggest source of lost revenue
    > for these appointment-based businesses is "no-shows" and
    > last-minute cancellations. A missed appointment is a perishable
    > slot that can't be resold. Standard calendar reminders are often
    > ignored.

-   **Proposed Solution: The "Automated Appointment Confirmation &
    > Waitlist System"  
    > **A smart, automated communication tool that integrates with their
    > existing booking system to drastically reduce no-shows.

    -   **Core Features:**

        1.  **Interactive SMS/WhatsApp Reminders:** Instead of just a
            > notification, the system sends a message 24-48 hours
            > before the appointment asking the client to reply "1 to
            > Confirm" or "2 to Reschedule." This forces an active
            > response and reduces passive no-shows.

        2.  **Automated Waitlist Management:** If a client cancels, the
            > system can automatically send a notification to a
            > pre-approved waitlist of clients, offering them the newly
            > available slot. The first to claim it gets it, filling the
            > empty slot with zero manual effort from staff.

        3.  **Deposit & Pre-payment Links:** For high-value or long
            > services, the confirmation message can include a secure
            > link for the client to place a small deposit to hold their
            > slot, creating a financial commitment that drastically
            > lowers the no-show rate.

    -   **Why it's a good opportunity:** The ROI is immediate and
        > measurable. If the service costs $100/month and prevents just
        > two no-shows for a $50 service, it has already paid for
        > itself. It directly plugs a major revenue leak for these
        > businesses.

### **Industry: F&B (specifically Cafés and Bakeries)**

-   **Specific Challenge:** Daily overproduction or underproduction of
    > perishable goods like pastries, cakes, and bread is a major source
    > of financial loss. Guessing daily demand based on gut feeling
    > leads to either costly food waste or missed sales opportunities
    > when popular items sell out too early.

-   **Proposed Solution: The "Daily Production AI Forecaster"  
    > **A simple, data-driven tool that integrates with their existing
    > Point-of-Sale (POS) system to provide intelligent recommendations
    > for daily production quantities.

    -   **Core Features:**

        1.  **POS Integration:** Securely connects to popular SME POS
            > systems (like Square, Shopify POS, etc.) to pull
            > historical sales data for individual items.

        2.  **Smart Forecasting:** An AI model analyzes past sales
            > patterns, factoring in variables like the day of the week,
            > recent sales trends, public holidays, and even local
            > weather forecasts (e.g., predicting higher demand for hot
            > coffee on rainy days).

        3.  **Simple Production List:** The output is a clear,
            > actionable list for the kitchen staff each morning, e.g.,
            > "Wednesday Recommendation: 50 Croissants, 35 Almond
            > Croissants, 20 Quiches." It would also show the previous
            > day's sales and leftover stock for comparison.

        4.  **End-of-Day Waste Tracker:** A simple input for staff to
            > log any unsold items. This data feeds back into the AI
            > model, making its future recommendations even more
            > accurate.

    -   **Why it's a good opportunity:** This tool has a direct and
        > immediate impact on an F&B outlet's profitability. By reducing
        > waste by even 10-15%, the service pays for itself very
        > quickly. It solves a daily, high-stress problem for business
        > owners and bakers, allowing them to make data-driven decisions
        > instead of guessing.

### **Industry: Retail (Fashion, Cosmetics, Specialty Goods)**

-   **Specific Challenge:** SMEs lack the sophisticated personalization
    > tools of e-commerce giants. A customer browses a product and
    > leaves, or makes a purchase and is never engaged again with
    > relevant offers. This results in a low conversion rate and a poor
    > customer lifetime value.

-   **Proposed Solution: The "Retail Growth Engine"  
    > **A smart, automated marketing tool that integrates with their
    > e-commerce platform (e.g., Shopify) and in-store POS to drive
    > repeat purchases and increase the value of every customer.

    -   **Direct Revenue Features:**

        1.  **AI-Powered Cross-Sell/Upsell:** Instead of generic
            > "related products," this tool analyzes purchase data to
            > create intelligent offers. After a customer buys a
            > specific dress, the system automatically follows up a week
            > later with an email showcasing "3 Ways to Style Your New
            > Dress," featuring matching shoes and accessories, each
            > with a "buy now" link.

        2.  **"Back in Stock" & "Price Drop" Alerts:** Automatically
            > captures a customer's interest when they visit a sold-out
            > product page. When the item is restocked, the system
            > instantly emails everyone on the waitlist, creating a rush
            > of sales. The same works for price drops.

        3.  **Smart Couponing:** Generates unique, single-use discount
            > codes for specific customer segments. For example, it can
            > automatically send a "We miss you, here's 15% off" coupon
            > to customers who haven't purchased in 90 days, directly
            > incentivizing a return visit and recovering a potentially
            > lost customer.

        4.  **Abandoned Cart Recovery:** Goes beyond a single reminder.
            > It can trigger a multi-step sequence: an email 1 hour
            > after cart abandonment, a follow-up 24 hours later with
            > customer reviews of the product, and a final offer 3 days
            > later with a small discount to close the sale.

    -   **Why it generates revenue:** Every feature is laser-focused on
        > a specific revenue action: increasing basket size, recovering
        > lost sales, and driving repeat business. You can directly
        > track how many sales were generated from each automated
        > campaign, making the ROI crystal clear.

### **Industry: Florists & Gift Shops**

-   **Specific Challenge:** Business is transactional and highly
    > seasonal (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day), leading to unpredictable
    > cash flow. They depend on customers remembering important dates
    > and choosing their shop each time. They have no reliable,
    > recurring revenue.

-   **Proposed Solution: The "Occasion Subscription & Gifting Portal"  
    > **A platform that transforms a one-time gift purchase into a
    > guaranteed, long-term recurring revenue stream.

    -   **Direct Revenue Features:**

        1.  **Personal Occasion Subscription:** The core feature. A
            > customer can create a "Gifting Calendar" for their loved
            > ones, inputting birthdays, anniversaries, etc. They
            > pre-authorize the shop to automatically select, charge,
            > and deliver a beautiful gift for each date. The customer's
            > problem is solved for the entire year, and the shop locks
            > in multiple future sales from a single interaction.

        2.  **Corporate Gifting Automation:** A dedicated portal for
            > other businesses to manage employee and client gifting. An
            > HR manager can upload a list of employee birthdays, and
            > the system automatically sends a gift on behalf of the
            > company each month, generating a lucrative B2B recurring
            > contract.

        3.  **"Never Forget" Upsell:** At the checkout of a standard
            > online order, a pop-up asks: "Don't want to forget next
            > year? Click here to make this an annual recurring order."
            > This simple prompt helps convert one-time buyers into
            > long-term subscription customers.

    -   **Why it generates revenue:** It creates predictable, year-round
        > recurring revenue in a traditionally volatile industry. It
        > dramatically increases customer lifetime value and builds a
        > "moat" around the business by solving a major pain point for
        > customers: the mental load of remembering special occasions.

 A monster is a type of imaginary or fictional creature found in literature, folklore, mythology, fiction and religion. They are very often depicted as dangerous and aggressive, with a strange or grotesque appearance that causes terror and fear, often in humans. Monsters usually resemble bizarre, deformed and idle-willy or mutated animals or entirely unique creatures of varying sizes, but may also take a human form such as mutants, ghost spirits, vampires or zombies, among others.

- if Score \>= 0\.5

## Slide 11: Why Is It Not Accurate?

- Limitations of Existing Deep Learning Detectors
- **03**

## Slide 12: DeepFakes Are EVOLVING

- Advanced Algorithms:New deepfake methods produce hyper-realistic content\.
- Complex Artifacts & Workflows:Sophisticated techniques reduce tell-tale signs \(e\.g\., lighting, texture inconsistencies\)\.

## Slide 13: Advanced DeepFake GENERATION

- ReActor:
- To Swap Faces
- Stable Diffusion 3 Medium:
- To Generate Facial Features \(Freckles, Blemishes, etc\.\.\)
- Upscaler:
- To Upscale Image up to 16x Resolution

## Slide 14: The Fault In current DETECTORS

- Generalization:
- Models trained on one dataset may not perform well on newer or different deepfake types\.
- Subtlety:
- Evolving techniques reduce obvious artifacts, making detection harder for general models\.
- Need for Specialization:
- Standard architectures like Xception \(trained on ImageNet\) are powerful feature extractors but require specific fine-tuning to capture the subtle, unique traces left by deepfake generation\.
- Performance Gaps:
- Even state-of-the-art models don't achieve perfect accuracy, especially against compressed or low-quality videos\.

## Slide 15: My Solution

- Building a Robust Deepfake Detector\.
- **04**

## Slide 16: High-Quality Dataset: DeepFakeBench

_Subtitle:_ Utilized DeepFakeBench, a comprehensive and widely recognized benchmark dataset for deepfake detection\\\.

- Presented at NeurIPS 2023\.
- Combines multiple deepfake generation methods for diversity:
- Face Swaps
- Lip Sync
- Expression Transfer
- & More
- Provides pre-processed data which simplifies input pipeline:
- 900K Fake & 95K Real RGB cropped & aligned face images

## Slide 17: Dataset Preparation & Augmentation

- Solution
- Challenge
- DeepFakeBench only has 95,000 real images\.
- Downsampling \[Fake\] & Balancing, then Splitting:
- 106,400 \(56%\)
- 45,600 \(24%\)
- 38,000 \(20%\)
- Training
- Validation
- Test
- Augmentation
- Applied on-the-fly during training using Keras Sequential layer to improve generalization:
- Random Horizontal Flips
- Random Rotations
- Random Zoom
- Random Contrast Adjustments

## Slide 18: The Approach: Fine-Tuning Xception

_Subtitle:_ Selected Xception architecture as the base model\\\.

- Why Xception?
- State of the art performance on ImageNet
- Good for capturing fine-grained textures and subtle artifacts
- Proven effectiveness in prior deepfake detection research \(Rossler et al\.\)
- However:
- Pre-trained on ImageNet \(1000 object classes\)
- Needs to be adapted to binary \(Real vs Fake\)
- So:
- Transfer Learning & Fine Tuning

## Slide 19: Modified Xception Architecture for Deepfake Detection

- Input Face \(224x224x3\)
- Xception Base
- \(Pre-trained on ImageNet\)
- Global Average Pooling 2D
- Dropout \(0\.5\)
- Dense Layer
- \(1 Neuron, Sigmoid Activation\)
- Output
- \(Probability Fake: 0 to 1\)
- Replaced original 1000-class classifier with a new binary classification head\.
- Classification Head
- Original \(**Removed**\)
- Phase 1 Training
- Phase 2 Training
- Total Parameters: ~20\.86M

## Slide 20: Xception TRAINING

- Phase 1: Transfer Learning
- Phase 2: Fine-Tuning
- Base Layers
- Top Layers
- Base Layers
- Top Layers
- Goal:
- Train the newly added classification head\.
- Freeze all layers of the base model
- Optimizer: SGD
- Learning Rate: 0\.03
- Momentum: 0\.9
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Learns to map existing Xception features to Real/Fake classification
- Goal:
- Adapt deeper Xception layers to deepfake specific features\.
- Unfreeze layers in the Xception base\.
- Optimizer: SGD
- Learning Rate: 0\.003
- Momentum: 0\.9
- Callbacks: ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping
- Allows the model to learn subtle inconsistencies \(lighting, symmetry, etc\.\)

  "extracted_text": "p = Process(target=info_agent_worker, args=(ia_result_queue,), print(\"[Main Process]: Starting Info Agent subprocess...\") p.start() p.join() print(\"[Main Process]: Subprocess has finished.\") imageAnalysis = ia_result_queue.get() print(\"[Main Process]: Received analysis result.\"))",
  "image_description": "The image contains a snippet of Python code related to multiprocessing. It demonstrates the creation of a subprocess using the `Process` class, passing a target function (`info_agent_worker`) and arguments (`ia_result_queue`). The main process prints messages indicating the start and completion of the subprocess, and it retrieves an analysis result from the queue. The code is structured to manage communication between processes through a queue."
